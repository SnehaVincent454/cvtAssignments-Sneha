<p class="paragraphHeadings" id="popping">Poppping Mechanism:</p>
<p>Each kernel of popcorn contain a certain amount of moisture and oil. Unlike most other grains, the outer hull of the popcorn kernel is both strong and impervious to mositure and the starch inside ocnsists almost entirely of a hard type. as the oil and water within the kernel are heated, they then turnthe moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached. Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yeild .

<p class="paragraphHeadings"id="terms">Terminology:</p>
<p>in the popcorn inductry, a popped kernal is known as "flakes".Two shapes of flakes are commercially important. "Butterfly" (or "Snowfalkes") flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of proturding "wings"."mushroom"flakes are largeely ball-shaped. with few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better mouthfeel, with greater tenderness and less noticable hulls. Mushroom flakes are less fragile then butterfly flakes and are therefore often used for packaged popcorn or confectionary, such as caramel corn. [19] The kernels form a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushtoom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly flakes or 100% exist, the latter developed only as recently 1998. Growing condition and popping environment cn also affect the butterfly-to-mushroom ratio. When  referring to multiple pieces of popcorn collectivly, it is acceptable to use the term "popcorn".When referring to a singular piece of popcorn, the accepted term is "kernel".</p>
